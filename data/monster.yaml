The {@condition charmed} target is under the aboleth's control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance.
          - Whenever the {@condition charmed} target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.

        entries:
          - The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.
          - Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.
          - A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

            name: Languages
            entries:
              - Most dragons prefer to speak Draconic but learn Common for dealing with allies and minions. But given their high Intelligence and long life span, dragons can easily learn additional languages. You can add languages to a dragon's stat block.

            name: Skills
            entries:
              - Most dragons are proficient in the {@skill Perception} and {@skill Stealth} skills, and many dragons have additional skill proficiencies. As with languages, you can customize a dragon's skill list (even doubling their proficiency bonus with certain skills) to reflect particular interests and activities. You can also give a dragon tool proficiencies, particularly if the dragon spends time in Humanoid form.

                      - The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).
                      - In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.

                      - The dragon can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful {@dc 9} Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check.

                      - You might decide that dragons in your campaign, being an essential part of the Material Plane, are nearly impossible to destroy. A dragon's life essence might be preserved in the egg from which it first emerged, in its hoard, or in a cavernous hall at the center of the world, just as a lich's essence is hidden in a phylactery.
                      - If it has an essence-preserving object, a destroyed dragon gains a new body in {@dice 1d10} days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the object.

Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a {@dc 18} Strength saving throw or be {@condition restrained} by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures {@condition restrained} by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

              - The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature's existence.
              - To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the {@spell wish} spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's benefit.

Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.
          - The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a {@dc 15} Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.

        entries:
          - Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition frightened} for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages {@dice 1d4 × 10} years. A {@condition frightened} target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the {@condition frightened} condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a  {@spell greater restoration} spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.
      - name: Possession {@recharge}
        entries:
          - One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a {@dc 13} Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is {@condition incapacitated} and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being {@condition charmed} and {@condition frightened}. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
          - The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the {@spell dispel evil and good} spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

          - The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a {@dc 11} Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed} until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is {@condition incapacitated}.
          - While {@condition charmed} by the harpy, a target is {@condition incapacitated} and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the {@condition charmed} target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, a target can repeat the saving throw. A creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.
          - A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24 hours.

        name: Imp Familiar
        entries:
          - Imps can be found in the service to mortal spellcasters, acting as advisors, spies, and familiars. An imp urges its master to acts of evil, knowing the mortal's soul is a prize the imp might ultimately claim. Imps display an unusual loyalty to their masters, and an imp can be quite dangerous if its master is threatened. Some such imps have the following trait.
          - name: Familiar
            type: entries
            entries:
              - The imp can enter into a contract to serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with its willing master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the imp senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the imp is within 10 feet of its master, the master shares the imp's Magic Resistance trait. If its master violates the terms of the contract, the imp can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.

If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 ({@dice 1d10}).

The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the  {@spell greater restoration} spell or similar magic.

While the quasit is within 10 feet of its master, the master shares the quasit's Magic Resistance trait. At any time and for any reason, the quasit can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.

            entries:
              - A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes {@damage 3d10} psychic damage and is {@condition blinded} for 24 hours.
              - A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while {@condition blinded}. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

        entries:
          - You can customize any dragon's stat block to reflect the dragon's unique character. Minor changes such as those below are easy to make and have no impact on a dragon's challenge rating.
          - type: entries
            name: Languages
            entries:
              - Most dragons prefer to speak Draconic but learn Common for dealing with allies and minions. But given their high Intelligence and long life span, dragons can easily learn additional languages. You can add languages to a dragon's stat block.
          - type: entries
            name: Skills
            entries:
              - Most dragons are proficient in the {@skill Perception} and {@skill Stealth} skills, and many dragons have additional skill proficiencies. As with languages, you can customize a dragon's skill list (even doubling their proficiency bonus with certain skills) to reflect particular interests and activities. You can also give a dragon tool proficiencies, particularly if the dragon spends time in Humanoid form.

                      - The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).
                      - In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.

                      - Impersonating characters or their allies could be a fun trick for a crafty dragon.
                      - The dragon can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful {@dc 10} Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check.

                    entries:
                      - You might decide that dragons in your campaign, being an essential part of the Material Plane, are nearly impossible to destroy. A dragon's life essence might be preserved in the egg from which it first emerged, in its hoard, or in a cavernous hall at the center of the world, just as a lich's essence is hidden in a phylactery.
                      - If it has an essence-preserving object, a destroyed dragon gains a new body in {@dice 1d10} days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the object.

              - The troll's speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls {@condition prone}. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to speed.

Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water.

A creature within 5 feet of the elemental can pull a creature or object out of it by taking an action to make a {@dc 14} Strength check and succeeding.

            entries:
              - Most dragons prefer to speak Draconic but learn Common for dealing with allies and minions. But given their high Intelligence and long life span, dragons can easily learn additional languages. You can add languages to a dragon's stat block.

            entries:
              - Most dragons are proficient in the {@skill Perception} and {@skill Stealth} skills, and many dragons have additional skill proficiencies. As with languages, you can customize a dragon's skill list (even doubling their proficiency bonus with certain skills) to reflect particular interests and activities. You can also give a dragon tool proficiencies, particularly if the dragon spends time in Humanoid form.

On a successful check, the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied space. {@actSaveSuccess} Half damage, and the target moves to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the cube.
